# Install Protocol

(For ease of explanation, assume the multisig is now magically owning 20 ETH and that the Free Balance has recorded a balance of 10, 10 for Alice and Bob. We will explain how depositing is implemented by using the `Install` and `Uninstall` protocols at the end.)

Running the install protocol to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe where Alice and Bob both bet 1 ETH transitions the counterfactual state to

![install](../images/install.png)

Notice how the funds move out of the free balance and into the tic-tac-toe application.

## Commitment

- updates the free balance state, decrementing both parties by the amount they contribute to the application install
- executes the conditional transfer via delegatecall, withdrawing the funds from the multisig and distributing them according to the state of the application which the conditional transfer points to.
